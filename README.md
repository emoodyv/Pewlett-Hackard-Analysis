# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to assist Bobby, an human resources analyst at Pewlett Hackard, in researching who will be
retiring in the next few years and how many rolls will Pewlett Harkard need to fill. This will help PH look to the future
and prepare adequately for the coming years.

## Results
Upon analyzing the vast amount of employee date there is 4 important points of note:
* There is a total of 300,024 employees in the company. Of those 300,024 there is an astounding 90,398 employees of retiring 
age. That represents 30.13% of the company. For PH, this should be a very concerning number.
* Of the employees of retiring age only 2 (of 90,398) are managers. This show that there is an extreme lack of upward
movement in the company and/or PH employees' careers plateau before they reach management levels. That rundown can be 
seen below:

* There is only 1,940 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This is far outweighted by the 90,398 on the edge of 
retirement. PH might want to consider hiring a plethora of employees to mentor and/or expanding the requirements from
the mentorship program.
* When looking at the salaries of the employees it appears PH underpays what engineers should be making.

## Summary
* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
If it is the goal of PH to replace each retiree the answer is 90,398. However this number will be spread over time. This 
is why PH needs to bolster its mentorship program and hiring process now.

* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett 
Hackard employees?
There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in order to mentor the next generation of employees. In fact there
is a surplus of 88,458. Because of this PH should capitalize on these soon to be retirees by bolstering its mentorship 
program and hiring process right away.
